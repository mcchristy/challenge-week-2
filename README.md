## About 
The goal of this project was to create a portfolio for my coding materials. This is just a rough draft with basic html and css. The page must include your name, a navigation toolbar that links to different sections on the page, those sections: About Me, My Work, & Contact Me. Resume is included in the navigation bar but does not yet have a place on the page.
